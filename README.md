# AshbyaTracking
This repository contains code pertaining to the work published in
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/10/30/823286.full.pdf

The code is written to be used within the interactive (proprietary) software
DataTank, available for Mac at
http://www.visualdatatools.com/DataTank/

Note that DataTank is not strictly speaking required, though it may take some work
to refactor the full pipeline to run without DataTank. Our code is written in C++
and Python (mostly Python 2.7) and uses widely available open libraries.
